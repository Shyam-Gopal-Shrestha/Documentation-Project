# Async/Await function in javascript

- Handle asynchronous operation like fetching data, reading files.
- Async is used to define function asynchronous.
- Asynchronous function always returns promise.
- Allows you to use await inside, it pause the execution of the asunc function until the promese passed to it resolves or rejects.
- while function is paused other code outside the async function can continue executiong.
- await makes async code look and behave like synchronous code, without blocking the entire program.
